Project Description

    Batangas State University TNEU - Lipa Campus faces challenges with manual event registration processes for Recognized Students Organization (RSO) events, leading to inefficiencies, lack of communication, and participant frustration. The proposed solution is to develop an Online Event Registration System tailored to RSO's needs, providing a centralized platform, implementing department-specific dashboards for efficient event management, enhancing communication, and improving overall efficiency.

System Functions

●	Event Viewing - Users can view all the current and upcoming events so they will be able to know in which event they will be interested in.

●	Pre-Registration - Users can register in advance for the upcoming events to be more efficient and timely.

●	Checking of Attendees - Users will be able to view who will be the attendees of the upcoming events to be able to know how many will attend the event.

●	User Profile - Users will see all the events that they have attended in their profile.
